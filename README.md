# Volumetric MRI Reconstruction from Motion Corrupted 2D Slices

This is a research-focused toolkit developed within the [GIFT-Surg](http://www.gift-surg.ac.uk/) project to reconstruct an isotropic, high-resolution volume from multiple, possibly motion-corrupted, stacks of low-resolution 2D slices. The framework relies on slice-to-volume registration algorithms for motion correction and reconstruction-based Super-Resolution (SR) techniques for the volumetric reconstruction. 
The entire reconstruction pipeline is programmed in Python by using a mix of SimpleITK, WrapITK and standard C++ITK. 

If you have any questions or comments (or find bugs), please drop an email to @mebner (`michael.ebner.14@ucl.ac.uk`).


# Installation
Clone the Volumetric MRI Reconstruction Toolkit by
* `git clone git@cmiclab.cs.ucl.ac.uk:mebner/VolumetricReconstruction.git`

and add this path to the environment variable `VOLUMETRIC_RECONSTRUCTION_DIR` 
by adding the line
* `export VOLUMETRIC_RECONSTRUCTION_DIR="path-to-VolumetricReconstrucion/"`

in your `.bashrc` file (or whatever you use for your terminal). Then the 
Volumetric Reconstruction Toolkit modules 
can be included in Python via `sys.path.insert(1, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.environ['VOLUMETRIC_RECONSTRUCTION_DIR'], 'src', 'py')))` later on.

## Installation of additional Python packages
This toolkit was developed and tested with Python 2 and relies on additional Python packages.
The required packages (and their tested versions) are stated in the file `requirements.txt`. These are 
* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `matplotlib`
* `SimpleITK`
* `nibabel`
* `Pillow`

and can be installed with `pip` (version >= 9.0) by running the command
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Installation of (Wrap)ITK
This tool builds on ITK 4.12 and relies on an extended version specifically developed for the Volumetric MRI Reconstruction toolkit. By following the instructions [here](https://cmiclab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mebner/ITK/wikis/home) an extended ITK package will be installed and made accessible to Python. This installation is certainly the most time-consuming process and may take a couple of hours to compile.

## Optional Packages

### Build ITK-cpp code
In case you want to use the classes
* `N4BiasFieldCorrection`
* `RegistrationITK`
* `NiftyReg`
* `SIENA`
* `BrainStripping`

(and possibly others) you will need to compile the code in `src/cpp`. Being in the root directory, compile the source code by linking it with the built ITK and Boost libraries via
* `mkdir -p build/cpp/`
* `cd build/cpp/`
* `cmake -D ITK_DIR=path-to-ITK-build_dev -D BOOST_ROOT=path-to-Boost-root ../../src/cpp/`
* `make -j`

On the cluster I encountered an issue with that compilation line. Adding `-DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON` did the [trick](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9948375/cmake-find-package-succeeds-but-returns-wrong-path). 

Therefore, example lines for compilations read
* `cmake -D ITK_DIR="~/development/ITK/ITK-build_dev" -D BOOST_ROOT="/opt/local/include" ../../src/cpp` (Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10)
* `cmake -D ITK_DIR="~/development/ITK/ITK-build_dev" -D BOOST_ROOT="/usr/include" ../../src/cpp` (Ubuntu 14.04)
* `/share/apps/cmake-3.6.2/bin/cmake -D ITK_DIR=~/development/ITK/ITK-build_dev -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON ../../src/cpp/evelopment/ITK/ITK-build_dev -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON ../../src/cpp` (Cluster 'wise')


### NiftyReg
The class `NiftyReg` provides a basic wrapper for [NiftyReg](http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg) and makes both `reg_aladin` and `reg_f3d` accessible to Python. Installation instructions for NiftyReg can be found on the website.


### Visualization
The Volumetric MRI Reconstruction Toolkit uses [ITK-SNAP](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) for the visualization of images. In case you want to make use of it, make sure ITK-SNAP is installed and can be accessed via `itksnap` from the command line.


## Code Documentation
A documentation for the Python source-files can be generated in case [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) is installed. Within the root folder `VolumetricReconstruction` run
* `cd doc/py`
* `doxygen doxyfile`
* `open html/index.html`


# Example usage
A simple example (without motion correction) can be found in `examples/reconstructStaticVolume`. Given a set of multi-planar stack of slice data the Super-Resolution reconstruction algorithm can be run by
* `python examples/reconstructStaticVolume.py --dir-input=path-to-data`
